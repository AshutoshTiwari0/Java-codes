 dynamic method dispatch
     in this we make classes and inherit them and we make a new object each time for a new class and assign all the objects to one varibale only 
 obj= new a();
     obj=new b();
   obj=new c();
   here each time a new object is created and assigned to same variable . so same variable is exsiting in many different forms.
